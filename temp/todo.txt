new download working
upgrade working

When the upgrade download having problem, redirecting to old download not working. I think there is a problem with localStorage 'undefined'.
It is not considering that the entry is not there... Somehow it is returning a string called 'undefined' and my app is considering that to be a valid version.
Or maybe it is taking that from the manifest (not the localStorage). Verify
