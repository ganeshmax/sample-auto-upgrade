Install Cordova:
Install Node.JS and NPM
sudo npm install -g cordova - This will install cordova-cli globally.
But you can also install cordova locally if you want using package.json, just that you cannot use "cordova create" to create a new cordova project

Create Project:
cordova create directoryName packageName projectName
cordova platform add ios
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.console - for console.log() to show up in XCode
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file-transfer - also installs "file" as dependent

cordova prepare ios
cordova compile ios

cordova build ios - to prepare and compile both in one step

Running or emulating ios directly from the root project directory is not working
cordova run ios && cordova emulate ios - not working, maybe with new XCode, not sure

Can emulate or run ios from the ios directory using ios specific command line tools
For that you will first have to install ios-sim and ios-deploy. These are cli tools that will help launch simulator or install on device
sudo npm install -g ios-sim
sudo npm install -g ios-deploy

Now emulate ios, but first by going to the ios platform directory and using the ios cli and not the general cli
cd platforms/ios
./cordova/emulate
./cordova/run
